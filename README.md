## About

This webapp was developed using Flask Web Framework and was deployed on Heroku server. The models used to predict the diseases were trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned below in this readme. The webapp can predict following Diseases:

- Diabetes
- Heart Disease
- Kidney Disease
- Liver Disease


## Models with their Accuracy of Prediction

| Disease        | Type of Model            | Accuracy |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| Diabetes       | Machine Learning Model   | 98.25%   |
| Heart Disease  | Machine Learning Model   | 85.25%   |
| Kidney Disease | Machine Learning Model   | 99%      |
| Liver Disease  | Machine Learning Model   | 87%      |
